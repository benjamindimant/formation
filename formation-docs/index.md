# Formation Protocol

A public verifiable and self-replicating protocol for trustless, confidential virtual private servers (VPS) coordinating as a Fog Compute network to power the Age of Autonomy.

## Welcome to Formation

Formation is building the infrastructure for the Age of Autonomy. Our protocol enables a decentralized network of compute resources that can be leveraged by developers to build and deploy applications in a secure, confidential environment.

## Key Features

- **Trustless Execution**: Run workloads with confidence on a network with cryptographic guarantees
- **Confidential Computing**: Keep your data and computations private and secure
- **Fog Compute Architecture**: Distributed network of compute resources for improved performance and resilience
- **Self-Replicating Protocol**: Designed to scale organically as the network grows
- **AI Inference Engine**: Support for AI model deployment and inference (coming soon)
