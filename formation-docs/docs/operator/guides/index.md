## Getting Started

If you're new to running a Formation operator node, we recommend following these guides in order:

1. Start with the [Getting Started](../getting-started/index.md) section
2. Follow the [Installation Guide](./installation.md) to set up your node
3. Use the [Configuration Wizard Guide](./configuration-wizard.md) to configure your node
4. Implement [Security Best Practices](./security-best-practices.md) to secure your node
5. Apply [Performance Tuning](./performance-tuning.md) to optimize your node

## Key Concepts for Operators

### Resource Pools

Formation uses resource pools to organize and allocate computing resources. Resource pools allow you to segment your hardware resources (CPU, memory, storage, and GPUs) into logical groups that can be allocated to different types of workloads.

### Instance Types

Instance types define the resource templates that users can select when deploying their applications. As an operator, you can define custom instance types based on your hardware capabilities and the needs of your users.

### Networking

Formation uses a custom overlay network called Formnet, built on WireGuard, to provide secure connectivity between instances. Understanding networking concepts is essential for troubleshooting connectivity issues and ensuring optimal performance.

### Staking and Rewards

Operators are required to stake tokens to participate in the network. This stake serves as a security deposit and also determines reward distribution. Understanding the economics of operating a node is crucial for long-term success.

## Best Practices Summary

Here are some key best practices for Formation operators:

1. **Regular Updates**: Keep your operating system and Formation software up to date with the latest security patches and features.

2. **Resource Planning**: Carefully plan your resource allocation to balance between maximizing utilization and maintaining performance.

3. **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting to quickly identify and resolve issues.

4. **Security**: Follow security best practices to protect your node and user workloads.

5. **Backups**: Regularly back up your configuration and critical data.

6. **Documentation**: Keep detailed documentation of your setup, configurations, and any customizations.

7. **Performance Tuning**: Optimize your node for performance based on your specific hardware and workload types.

8. **Community Engagement**: Participate in the Formation operator community to share experiences and learn from others.
