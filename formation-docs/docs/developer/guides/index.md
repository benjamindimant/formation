## Getting Started

If you're new to Formation, we recommend following these guides in order:

1. Start with the [Quick Start Guide](./quick-start.md) to deploy your first application
2. Learn about [Writing Formfiles](./writing-formfiles.md) to understand the deployment configuration
3. Explore [Using Ethereum Wallets](./using-ethereum-wallets.md) to set up authentication
4. Master [Managing Instances](./managing-instances.md) to control your deployments
5. Understand [Networking](./networking.md) to configure connectivity for your applications

## Core Concepts for Developers

### Formfiles

Formfiles are the primary way to define your application's environment, resources, and configuration. Similar to Dockerfiles, they use a declarative syntax to specify how your application should be built and deployed.

### Instances

Instances are the running deployments of your application. Each instance is a virtual machine with its own resources, networking, and storage.

### Ethereum Authentication

Formation uses Ethereum-based authentication, allowing you to use existing Ethereum wallets for secure, cryptographic authentication and authorization.

### Formnet

Formation's custom overlay network provides secure connectivity between your instances and to the public internet, with built-in DNS resolution and service discovery.

## Best Practices Summary

Here are some key best practices for Formation developers:

1. **Write Efficient Formfiles**: Keep your Formfiles simple, use multi-stage builds, and follow the practices in the [Writing Formfiles](./writing-formfiles.md) guide.

2. **Manage Resources Carefully**: Request only the resources your application needs to optimize costs while ensuring performance.

3. **Secure Your Applications**: Follow the security recommendations in the [Security Best Practices](./security-best-practices.md) guide.

4. **Optimize Networking**: Configure your networking properly to ensure good performance and security.

5. **Use Appropriate Instance Types**: Select instance types that match your application's requirements.

6. **Implement Monitoring**: Set up monitoring and logging to understand your application's behavior and troubleshoot issues.

7. **Automate Deployments**: Integrate Formation with your CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments.

8. **Test Thoroughly**: Test your applications in a staging environment before deploying to production.

## Common Workflows

### Developing a New Application

1. Initialize a new project: `form kit templates create --template <template-name> --name <your-app>`
2. Customize the generated Formfile
3. Build and deploy: `form deploy`
4. Access your application via the provided URL

### Updating an Existing Application

1. Make changes to your application code
2. Rebuild and deploy: `form deploy`
3. Verify the updated application is working as expected

### Scaling an Application

1. Modify the Formfile to adjust resources (VCPU, MEM, DISK)
2. Redeploy with the updated resources: `form deploy`
3. Monitor performance to ensure adequate scaling
