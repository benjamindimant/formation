# Stateful Elastic Scaling Planning

## Overview

Stateful Elastic Scaling enables dynamic scaling of compute resources without losing application state. This capability allows instances to scale up/down or in/out as needed, while preserving the running application state.

## Implementation Status

### 1. Extend InstanceCluster Data Structure (✅ COMPLETED)

We have successfully completed the extension of the InstanceCluster data structure to support scaling operations:

- ✅ Added `ScalingPolicy` struct with configuration parameters for min/max instances, target CPU utilization, and cooldown periods
- ✅ Added `ScalingOperation` enum for representing scale-in, scale-out, and instance replacement operations
- ✅ Added `ScalingStatus` enum to track operation progress, completion, or failure
- ✅ Added `ScalingOperationRecord` struct to maintain history of scaling operations
- ✅ Extended `InstanceCluster` with new fields to track current scaling status and history
- ✅ Implemented getter/setter methods for accessing and modifying scaling configuration
- ✅ Added validation methods to ensure scaling parameters are valid
- ✅ Implemented methods for managing scaling operations (start, complete, fail, cancel)
- ✅ Added helper methods for selecting instances to remove during scale-in
- ✅ Added unit tests to validate all new functionality
- ✅ Verified CRDT integration with serialization/deserialization and merging
- ✅ Fixed type mismatch issue with ScalingOperations and InstanceCluster initialization

### 2. Implement State Transitions for Scaling Operations (⬜ IN PROGRESS)

The next step is to implement state transitions for scaling operations, enabling the system to handle the lifecycle of scaling events:

- ✅ Design state machine for scaling operations
  - ✅ Defined all states and their properties
  - ✅ Documented valid state transitions and conditions
  - ✅ Designed error handling and recovery paths
  - ✅ Created state machine diagram
  - ✅ Outlined implementation considerations
- ✅ Implement the state machine based on design
  - ✅ Create `form-state/src/scaling.rs` file with module structure
  - ✅ Create `ScalingPhase` enum with all states and their properties
  - ✅ Implement `ScalingManager` struct for managing the state machine
  - ✅ Add methods for state transitions with validation
  - ✅ Implement timeout handling mechanism
  - ✅ Add error handling and recovery mechanisms
  - ✅ Integrate state machine with `InstanceCluster`
  - ✅ Add serialization/deserialization support for persistence
  - ✅ Implement unit tests for the state machine
- ✅ Implement phases of scaling operations
  - ✅ Implement validate_scaling_operation with validation logic
  - ✅ Implement collect_cluster_metrics to gather resource usage data
  - ✅ Implement plan_scaling_operation to calculate resources needed
  - ✅ Implement allocate_resources_for_operation to prepare resources
  - ✅ Implement prepare_instances for instance preparation
  - ✅ Implement apply_configuration_changes for actual scaling
  - ✅ Implement verify_scaling_operation to ensure changes succeeded
  - ✅ Implement finalize_scaling_operation for cleanup tasks
- ⬜ Develop metrics collection for scaling operations
- ⬜ Create transition validation to ensure correct progression through states
- ⬜ Add rollback capabilities for failed operations
- ⬜ Implement event logging for state transitions
- ✅ Add tests for basic state machine transitions and functionality

### 3. Implement Hot-Add Capabilities (⬜ PLANNED)

After state transitions are in place, we'll need to implement the actual resource addition/removal capabilities:

- ⬜ Research technical approach for hot-adding resources in different virtualization environments
- ⬜ Implement hot-add capabilities for CPU, memory, and storage
- ⬜ Create seamless storage migration between tiers
- ⬜ Build resource monitoring and recommendation system

### 4. Implement State Preservation (⬜ PLANNED)

The final phase will focus on preserving application state during scaling operations:

- ⬜ Design architecture for preserving application state during scaling operations
- ⬜ Implement state preservation mechanisms
- ⬜ Create testing framework for scaling operations
- ⬜ Build rollback mechanisms for failed scaling operations

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Design state machine for scaling operations - COMPLETED
2. ✅ Implement the state machine based on the design in `scaling_state_machine_design.md` document - COMPLETED
   - ✅ Create `form-state/src/scaling.rs` file with module structure
   - ✅ Create core data structures (`ScalingPhase` enum and `ScalingManager` struct)
   - ✅ Implement state transition logic with validation
   - ✅ Add error handling and timeout mechanisms
   - ✅ Integrate with `InstanceCluster`
   - ✅ Add comprehensive test coverage
3. ✅ Create scaffolding for each phase of the scaling process
4. ✅ Implement core functionality for each phase of the scaling process
   - ✅ Fix compatibility issues with NetworkMetrics and DiskMetrics integration
   - ✅ Ensure proper resource estimation with realistic values (10GB disk size per instance)
5. ⬜ Add additional test coverage for state transitions and error cases
6. ⬜ Implement rollback capabilities for failed operations
7. ⬜ Create comprehensive event logging system for scaling operations

## Technical Considerations

- The state machine should be resilient to failures
- Transitions must be idempotent where possible
- The system should collect metrics at each phase for performance analysis
- Error handling should include appropriate recovery mechanisms
- The implementation should minimize disruption to running applications
