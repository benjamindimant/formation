# Stateful Elastic Scaling Planning

## Overview

Stateful Elastic Scaling enables dynamic scaling of compute resources without losing application state. This capability allows instances to scale up/down or in/out as needed, while preserving the running application state.

## Implementation Status

### 1. Extend InstanceCluster Data Structure (✅ COMPLETED)

We have successfully completed the extension of the InstanceCluster data structure to support scaling operations:

- ✅ Added `ScalingPolicy` struct with configuration parameters for min/max instances, target CPU utilization, and cooldown periods
- ✅ Added `ScalingOperation` enum for representing scale-in, scale-out, and instance replacement operations
- ✅ Added `ScalingStatus` enum to track operation progress, completion, or failure
- ✅ Added `ScalingOperationRecord` struct to maintain history of scaling operations
- ✅ Extended `InstanceCluster` with new fields to track current scaling status and history
- ✅ Implemented getter/setter methods for accessing and modifying scaling configuration
- ✅ Added validation methods to ensure scaling parameters are valid
- ✅ Implemented methods for managing scaling operations (start, complete, fail, cancel)
- ✅ Added helper methods for selecting instances to remove during scale-in
- ✅ Added unit tests to validate all new functionality
- ✅ Verified CRDT integration with serialization/deserialization and merging
- ✅ Fixed type mismatch issue with ScalingOperations and InstanceCluster initialization

### 2. Implement State Transitions for Scaling Operations (✅ COMPLETED)

We have successfully implemented state transitions for scaling operations, enabling the system to handle the lifecycle of scaling events:

- ✅ Design state machine for scaling operations
  - ✅ Defined all states and their properties
  - ✅ Documented valid state transitions and conditions
  - ✅ Designed error handling and recovery paths
  - ✅ Created state machine diagram
  - ✅ Outlined implementation considerations
- ✅ Implement the state machine based on design
  - ✅ Create `form-state/src/scaling.rs` file with module structure
  - ✅ Create `ScalingPhase` enum with all states and their properties
  - ✅ Implement `ScalingManager` struct for managing the state machine
  - ✅ Add methods for state transitions with validation
  - ✅ Implement timeout handling mechanism
  - ✅ Add error handling and recovery mechanisms
  - ✅ Integrate state machine with `InstanceCluster`
  - ✅ Add serialization/deserialization support for persistence
  - ✅ Implement unit tests for the state machine
- ✅ Implement phases of scaling operations
  - ✅ Implement validate_scaling_operation with validation logic
  - ✅ Implement collect_cluster_metrics to gather resource usage data
  - ✅ Implement plan_scaling_operation to calculate resources needed
  - ✅ Implement allocate_resources_for_operation to prepare resources
  - ✅ Implement prepare_instances for instance preparation
  - ✅ Implement apply_configuration_changes for actual scaling
  - ✅ Implement verify_scaling_operation to ensure changes succeeded
  - ✅ Implement finalize_scaling_operation for cleanup tasks
- ✅ Add tests for basic state machine transitions and functionality

### 3. Implement Rollback Capabilities for Failed Operations (⬜ IN PROGRESS)

To ensure the system can recover from failures during scaling operations, we need to implement comprehensive rollback capabilities:

- ✅ Enhance Operation History Tracking
  - ✅ Extend `ScalingOperationRecord` to store detailed phase-specific information
  - ✅ Implement data structures for tracking phase-specific rollback information
  - ✅ Fix serialization and hashing issues by replacing HashMap with BTreeMap for collections
  - ✅ Ensure proper trait implementations (Hash, Serialize, Deserialize) for all data types
  - ✅ Validate data structure changes with comprehensive tests

- ⬜ Create Phase-specific Rollback Operations
  - ⬜ Design rollback function signature and error handling
  - ⬜ Implement rollback for Resource Allocation phase
  - ⬜ Implement rollback for Instance Preparation phase
  - ⬜ Implement rollback for Configuration Changes phase
  - ⬜ Implement rollback for other phases as needed
  - ⬜ Add validation to ensure rollback is possible for each phase

- ⬜ Implement Automatic Failure Detection & Handling
  - ⬜ Create failure threshold definitions for each phase
  - ⬜ Implement automatic detection of stuck or failed operations
  - ⬜ Add timeout-based failure detection for long-running operations
  - ⬜ Create health check mechanism for in-progress operations
  - ⬜ Implement automatic rollback triggering on failure detection

- ⬜ Develop Clean State Restoration Mechanism
  - ⬜ Implement clean restoration of cluster membership data
  - ⬜ Create mechanism to restore instance network configurations
  - ⬜ Implement resource cleanup for partially allocated resources
  - ⬜ Add verification steps to confirm complete state restoration
  - ⬜ Create comprehensive logging for the restoration process

- ⬜ Testing and Integration
  - ⬜ Create unit tests for each rollback function
  - ⬜ Implement integration tests for full rollback sequences
  - ⬜ Add stress tests for concurrent operations with failures
  - ⬜ Create test scenarios for different failure conditions
  - ⬜ Implement validation of cluster state after rollback

### 4. Improved Testing Framework (⬜ PLANNED)

To ensure the reliability and robustness of the scaling system, we need comprehensive testing:

- ⬜ Add integration tests with simulated resources
- ⬜ Implement stress tests for concurrent scaling operations
- ⬜ Create test cases for failure scenarios and rollbacks
- ⬜ Test against various cluster configurations

### 5. Automated Metric-based Scaling (⬜ PLANNED)

Once the foundation is solidly tested, we will add automation:

- ⬜ Implement periodic metric collection and evaluation
- ⬜ Add automatic scaling operation triggering based on thresholds
- ⬜ Create configurable policies for different scaling scenarios
- ⬜ Implement cooldown periods to prevent scaling thrashing

### 6. Implement Hot-Add Capabilities (⬜ FUTURE)

After state transitions are in place, we'll need to implement the actual resource addition/removal capabilities:

- ⬜ Research technical approach for hot-adding resources in different virtualization environments
- ⬜ Implement hot-add capabilities for CPU, memory, and storage
- ⬜ Create seamless storage migration between tiers
- ⬜ Build resource monitoring and recommendation system

### 7. Implement State Preservation (⬜ FUTURE)

The final phase will focus on preserving application state during scaling operations:

- ⬜ Design architecture for preserving application state during scaling operations
- ⬜ Implement state preservation mechanisms
- ⬜ Create testing framework for scaling operations
- ⬜ Build rollback mechanisms for failed scaling operations

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Design state machine for scaling operations - COMPLETED
2. ✅ Implement the state machine based on the design in `scaling_state_machine_design.md` document - COMPLETED
3. ✅ Create scaffolding for each phase of the scaling process - COMPLETED
4. ✅ Implement core functionality for each phase of the scaling process - COMPLETED
   - ✅ Fix compatibility issues with NetworkMetrics and DiskMetrics integration
   - ✅ Ensure proper resource estimation with realistic values (10GB disk size per instance)
5. ⬜ Implement rollback capabilities for failed operations - CURRENT FOCUS
   - ✅ Extend `ScalingOperationRecord` to store detailed phase-specific information - COMPLETED
   - ⬜ Design and implement rollback functions for each phase - NEXT TASK
   - ⬜ Complete other rollback sub-tasks in sequence
6. ⬜ Develop improved testing framework
7. ⬜ Implement automated metric-based scaling
8. ⬜ Add additional event logging system for scaling operations

## Technical Considerations

- The state machine should be resilient to failures
- Transitions must be idempotent where possible
- The system should collect metrics at each phase for performance analysis
- Error handling should include appropriate recovery mechanisms
- The implementation should minimize disruption to running applications
- Rollback mechanisms must ensure complete restoration of previous state
- Automated scaling must include safeguards against thrashing 
- Use BTreeMap instead of HashMap for data structures requiring Hash trait implementation
- Ensure all serializable data structures implement proper traits (Serialize, Deserialize, Hash, etc.)
