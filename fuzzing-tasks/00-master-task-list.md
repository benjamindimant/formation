## Task Tracking

Each task is assigned a unique ID with the format `P<phase>-<component>.<task>`. For example, `P2-3.4` refers to Phase 2, Component 3, Task 4.

Tasks include the following information:
- **ID**: Unique identifier
- **Description**: Brief description of the task
- **Dependencies**: IDs of tasks that must be completed first
- **Estimated Effort**: Estimated time to complete the task (in days)
- **Status**: Current status (Not Started, In Progress, Complete)
- **Steps**: Detailed steps required to complete the task

## Progress Monitoring

To monitor progress on the fuzzing implementation:

1. Update the status of each task as it progresses through implementation
2. Track actual time spent against estimated effort
3. Identify bottlenecks or delays early
4. Adjust priorities based on findings during implementation
5. Report progress weekly, including:
   - Tasks completed
   - Tasks in progress
   - Blockers or issues
   - Adjusted estimates if needed

## Critical Path

The critical path for this implementation focuses on:

1. Core infrastructure (Phase 1)
2. Critical component fuzzing (Phase 2)
3. Integration fuzzing for critical components (Phase 5.1)
4. Live environment fuzzing (Phase 5.2)

Tasks on this path should be prioritized to ensure timely delivery of the fuzzing implementation.

## Risk Management

Identified risks for this implementation include:

1. **Codebase Complexity**: Some components may be more complex than initially estimated
2. **Missing Dependencies**: Discovery of undocumented dependencies during implementation
3. **Resource Constraints**: Limited availability of developers with fuzzing expertise
4. **Live Testing Risk**: Potential for production impact during live testing

Mitigation strategies are included in the individual task documents.
