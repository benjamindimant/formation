DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself.

Always check the codebase before implementing a task to make sure the work we are about to do needs to be done and has not been done before.

Write code in a way that it can be reused in the future for other things that it might apply to if possible, sometimes it is not possible.

Check the codebase to make sure that the task you are working on has not been completed yet before implementing it.
