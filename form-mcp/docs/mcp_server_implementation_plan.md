# MCP Server Implementation Plan for Formation Network

## Overall Status: Phase 1 (100% Complete)

Current status:
- ✅ Core infrastructure is implemented and functional
- ✅ VM management tools are fully implemented (status, control, create, list, delete)
- ✅ Operations repository for long-running tasks is complete
- ✅ API endpoint structure is in place
- ✅ Automated cleanup for expired operations is working
- ✅ Authentication and authorization system is implemented with JWT tokens
  - ✅ Keypair management and signature verification working
  - ✅ Token-based authentication with proper validation 
  - ✅ Authorization middleware protecting endpoints
- ✅ Pack build and ship functionality implemented
  - ✅ Support for Formfile-based workload definitions
  - ✅ Integration with queue system for build and deployment operations
  - ✅ Documentation for pack tools

Remaining tasks:
- Testing with Claude Desktop
- Basic security testing
- Documentation improvements

### 2.4 Workload Management

The MCP server provides tools for managing workloads through the Formation pack system. This includes:

#### 2.4.1 Pack Build Tool

The Pack Build Tool allows AI agents and users to build workloads from Formfile specifications. It supports:

- Defining workloads using Formfile format (JSON/YAML)
- Including context files for the build
- Specifying resource requirements
- Configuring network settings
- Setting environment variables and exposed ports

#### 2.4.2 Pack Ship Tool

The Pack Ship Tool enables deploying built workloads to Formation instances. It supports:

- Deploying workloads by build ID
- Configuring VM resources for the deployment
- Specifying network settings
- Tracking deployment status

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.5 Pack Management Implementation

#### 3.5.1 Formfile Structure

The Formfile structure defines how workloads are built and configured:

```json
{
  "from": "base-image",
  "name": "workload-name",
  "run": ["command1", "command2"],
  "include": ["file1", "file2"],
  "env": {"KEY": "VALUE"},
  "expose": [port1, port2],
  "entrypoint": "command",
  "resources": {
    "vcpus": count,
    "memory_mb": size,
    "disk_gb": size
  },
  "network": {
    "join_formnet": boolean
  },
  "metadata": {"key": "value"}
}
```

#### 3.5.2 Build Process

The build process follows these steps:

1. Client submits a Formfile and context files to the Pack Build Tool
2. The tool validates the Formfile format and content
3. The request is sent to the queue system with the topic "pack.build"
4. The pack manager processes the build request
5. A build ID is returned to the client for tracking

#### 3.5.3 Deployment Process

The deployment process follows these steps:

1. Client submits a build ID and configuration to the Pack Ship Tool
2. The tool validates the request parameters
3. The request is sent to the queue system with the topic "pack.ship"
4. The pack manager deploys the workload to a Formation instance
5. A deployment ID is returned to the client for tracking
