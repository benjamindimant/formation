# Formation MCP Server (form-mcp)

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for the Formation network, enabling AI agents to manage workload lifecycles securely and efficiently.

## Overview

The MCP server provides a standardized interface for AI agents to interact with and manage Formation network resources. By implementing the MCP specification, it ensures compatibility with various AI clients while providing powerful management capabilities specific to the Formation network.

## Features

- **Tool Registry System**: Register, discover, and execute tools for managing workloads
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Secure access to Formation network management functions
- **VM Lifecycle Management**: Create, control, and monitor VMs
- **Network Configuration**: Manage network settings and connections
- **Metrics & Monitoring**: Collect and analyze resource usage data
- **Policy Enforcement**: Apply safety and security policies to management actions

## Current Status

This project is under active development. Currently implemented:

- [x] Basic project structure and module layout
- [x] Core tool registry data structures
- [x] Registry management functionality
- [x] Placeholder modules for key components

## Architecture

The MCP server follows a modular architecture to separate concerns and enable extensibility:
