### Deterministic Cluster Formation

The system uses a fully deterministic approach to forming inference clusters:

1. **XOR-Based Clustering**:
   - Use XOR distance between node IDs and derived "center points"
   - Center points are calculated from consensus data accessible to all nodes
   - Each node independently computes the same cluster memberships

2. **Algorithm Details**:
   ```
   1. Generate seed from consensus timestamp and network topology
   2. Derive k cluster center IDs using deterministic hash function
   3. For each node:
      a. Calculate XOR distance to each center
      b. Assign to closest center's cluster
   4. Nodes independently arrive at identical cluster assignments
   ```

3. **Adaptive Reconfiguration**:
   - Adjust clusters based on consensus timestamps
   - New nodes self-assign to appropriate clusters
   - Departing nodes trigger deterministic redistribution of responsibility

        C1[Center 1] --- N1[Node 1]
        C1 --- N2[Node 2]
        C1 --- N3[Node 3]

        C3[Center 3] --- N6[Node 6]
        C3 --- N7[Node 7]
        C3 --- N8[Node 8]
        C3 --- N9[Node 9]
    end
    
    subgraph "Deterministic Assignment"
        S[Consensus State] --> |Generate Centers| Centers[Center IDs]
        Centers --> |XOR Distance| Assignment[Cluster Assignment]
        Assignment --> Cluster1[Cluster 1: Nodes 1,2,3]
        Assignment --> Cluster2[Cluster 2: Nodes 4,5]
        Assignment --> Cluster3[Cluster 3: Nodes 6,7,8,9]
    end
```

### Leaderless Shard Distribution

The system implements a leaderless approach to model shard distribution:

1. **Deterministic Shard Assignment**:
   - Create a unique shard ID for each model component
   - Calculate XOR distance between shard IDs and node IDs
   - Assign shards to nodes with smallest XOR distance

2. **Algorithm Details**:
   ```
   1. Generate shard IDs from model ID and shard index
   2. For each shard:
      a. Calculate XOR distance to each node in the cluster
      b. Assign primary responsibility to closest node
      c. Assign backup responsibility to next N closest nodes
   3. Each node independently determines its responsibilities
   ```

3. **Self-Organizing Recovery**:
   - Nodes detect failures through consensus mechanism
   - Backup nodes activate based on deterministic order
   - System reorganizes without central coordination

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Model Sharding"
        M[Model ID] --> |Hash Function| S1[Shard 1 ID]
        M --> |Hash Function| S2[Shard 2 ID]
        M --> |Hash Function| S3[Shard 3 ID]
    end

        XD2 --> |Closest| N7[Node 7: Primary]
        XD2 --> |Second Closest| N3[Node 3: Backup]
        
        S3 --> |XOR Distance| XD3[Calculate Distances]
        XD3 --> |Closest| N4[Node 4: Primary]
        XD3 --> |Second Closest| N1[Node 1: Backup]
    end
```
