# Resource Clustering Project Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for implementing resource clustering in the Formation network. Unlike high-availability clustering (which provides redundancy), resource clustering aims to combine resources from multiple physical nodes to behave as a unified resource, enabling workloads that exceed any single node's capabilities.

## Goals

1. **Enable large-scale workloads** that require more resources than any single node can provide
2. **Utilize specialized resource distribution** when different nodes have complementary resources
3. **Support dynamic scaling** allowing workloads to grow beyond initial allocations
4. **Present a unified interface** to workloads regardless of physical resource distribution

## Key Technical Components

### 1. Resource Aggregation Layer

This layer presents aggregated resources to workloads as if they were a single unified system.

```rust
pub struct AggregatedResourcePool {
    // Tracks total available resources across all participating nodes
    total_cpu_cores: u32,
    total_memory: u64, // in bytes
    total_storage: u64, // in bytes
    total_gpu_resources: HashMap<String, u8>, // model -> count
    
    // Maps resources back to their physical locations
    resource_mapping: HashMap<ResourceId, NodeId>,
    
    // Active connections to cluster members
    cluster_connections: HashMap<NodeId, ClusterNodeConnection>,
}
```

### 2. Workload Partitioning Engine

Responsible for dividing workloads into components that can be distributed across nodes.

```rust
pub trait WorkloadPartitioner {
    // Split a workload into components that can be distributed
    fn partition_workload(&self, workload: &Formfile) 
        -> Result<Vec<PartitionedWorkload>, PartitionError>;
        
    // Assign partitions to specific nodes based on their resources
    fn assign_partitions(&self, 
                         partitions: Vec<PartitionedWorkload>,
                         available_nodes: Vec<Node>) 
        -> Result<HashMap<PartitionedWorkload, NodeId>, AssignmentError>;
}
```

### 3. Inter-Node Communication Protocol

Enables efficient communication between nodes participating in the resource cluster.

```rust
pub struct ClusterCommunicationProtocol {
    // Streams for memory sharing
    shared_memory_channels: HashMap<PartitionId, MemoryChannel>,
    
    // State synchronization
    state_sync: ClusterStateSync,
    
    // Resource monitoring
    resource_monitors: Vec<ResourceMonitor>,
}
```

### 4. Failure Detection and Recovery

Manages detection of node failures and implements recovery strategies.

```rust
pub struct ClusterFailureDetector {
    // Monitor node health
    health_checkers: HashMap<NodeId, HealthChecker>,
    
    // Recovery strategies
    recovery_strategies: Vec<Box<dyn RecoveryStrategy>>,
    
    // State transfer mechanisms for taking over failed partitions
    state_transfer_engine: StateTransferEngine,
}
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Cluster Formation and Resource Discovery

1. **Extend capability matcher**
   - Enhance the existing capability matcher to identify clusters of nodes that together meet workload requirements
   - Implement algorithms to find optimal node combinations for specific resource requirements
   - Create scoring mechanisms for different cluster configurations

2. **Cluster connection management**
   - Establish secure, efficient connections between cooperating nodes
   - Implement connection pooling and management
   - Handle connection failures and reconnection logic

3. **Resource inventory and aggregation**
   - Create a unified view of available resources across all cluster nodes
   - Implement resource reservation protocols
   - Develop resource allocation tracking

### Phase 2: Workload Partitioning

1. **Define partitioning strategies**
   - Create different strategies for various workload types (compute-intensive, memory-intensive, etc.)
   - Define interfaces for custom partitioning strategies
   - Implement default partitioning approaches

2. **Implement partition assignment algorithm**
   - Develop algorithms to match partitions with appropriate nodes
   - Consider data locality, network topology, and resource availability
   - Optimize for minimal inter-node communication

   - Create systems to run workload partitions across multiple nodes
   - Implement synchronization mechanisms
   - Manage execution lifecycle across the cluster

2. **Resource monitoring and rebalancing**
   - Continuously monitor resource utilization
   - Implement algorithms to rebalance workloads as needed
   - Create policies for resource allocation adjustments

3. **Failure detection and recovery**
   - Implement heartbeat mechanisms
   - Develop partition migration strategies
   - Create state recovery protocols

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization

1. **Data locality optimization**
   - Analyze data access patterns
   - Optimize partition placement based on data locality
   - Implement data caching strategies

3. **Dynamic scaling**
   - Enable adding/removing nodes from a cluster during execution
   - Implement seamless resource pool expansion/contraction
   - Create policies for automatic scaling decisions

## Technical Challenges

1. **Network Latency**
   - Distributed workloads face increased communication overhead
   - Need to minimize cross-node communication
   - Must implement efficient serialization and transport protocols

2. **State Consistency**
   - Maintaining consistent state across distributed components is complex
   - Need for distributed consensus in some scenarios
   - Must handle partial failures gracefully

3. **Failure Handling**
   - Nodes may fail during workload execution
   - Need strategies for data recovery and task reassignment
   - Must minimize impact on overall workload execution

4. **Resource Sharing Granularity**
   - Determining optimal level of resource sharing is difficult
   - Too fine-grained: excessive overhead
   - Too coarse-grained: inefficient resource utilization

5. **Scheduling Complexity**
   - Multi-node scheduling is much more complex than single-node
   - Need to consider network topology and data locality
   - Must balance load while minimizing fragmentation

## Integration with Existing Systems

The resource clustering system will integrate with the following components:

1. **form-node-metrics**
   - Extend to report more detailed resource characteristics

   - Add metrics specific to inter-node communication

2. **form-pack**
   - Enhance to support partitioned workloads
   - Add capabilities for distributed builds
   - Implement multi-node deployment strategies

3. **form-state**

   - Maintain partition location mapping

4. **Network layer**

   - Implement efficient data transfer protocols
   - Support prioritization of cluster traffic

## Success Metrics

1. **Resource Utilization**
   - Improved overall resource utilization across the network
   - Reduction in idle resources while workloads wait for large nodes
