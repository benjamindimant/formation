# Scaling State Machine Design

## 1. States and Their Properties

### Initial State
- **Requested**: The scaling operation has been requested but not yet validated or started.
  - Properties:
    - Operation type (scale-out, scale-in, replace)
    - Target configuration (instances, resources)
    - Request timestamp
    - Requesting entity/user

### Validation and Planning States
- **Validating**: Validating that the requested operation is permissible.
  - Properties:
    - Current system state (instances, resources)
    - Validation checks (quota, capacity, policy constraints)
    - Validation start timestamp
    
- **Planning**: Planning the execution of the scaling operation.
  - Properties:
    - Resource requirements
    - Execution strategy
    - Planning start timestamp
    - Pre-operation metrics (CPU, memory, network usage)

### Execution States
- **ResourceAllocating**: Allocating the necessary resources for scaling.
  - Properties:
    - Resources being allocated
    - Allocation start timestamp
    - Provider-specific allocation details
    
- **InstancePreparing**: Preparing instances for addition or removal.
  - Properties:
    - Instance IDs affected
    - Preparation actions required
    - Preparation start timestamp
    
- **Configuring**: Applying configuration changes to the cluster.
  - Properties:
    - Configuration parameters
    - Configuration start timestamp
    - Previous configuration state (for rollback)
    
- **Verifying**: Verifying that the changes were applied correctly.
  - Properties:
    - Verification tests
    - Verification start timestamp
    - Test results
    
- **Finalizing**: Performing cleanup and final adjustments.
  - Properties:
    - Cleanup tasks
    - Finalization start timestamp
    - Post-operation metrics

### Terminal States
- **Completed**: The scaling operation completed successfully.
  - Properties:
    - Completion timestamp
    - Operation duration
    - Result metrics (before/after comparison)
    
- **Failed**: The scaling operation failed.
  - Properties:
    - Failure timestamp
    - Error details (type, message)
    - Failure phase
    - Partial results (if any)
    
- **Canceled**: The scaling operation was manually canceled.
  - Properties:
    - Cancellation timestamp
    - Cancellation reason
    - Phase at cancellation

## 2. State Timeout Handling

Each non-terminal state should have:
- Maximum allowed duration
- Timeout action (fail, retry, escalate)
- Timeout notification mechanism

## 3. State Persistence Requirements

The state machine needs to persist:
- Current state
- State history (transitions with timestamps)
- Properties relevant to current state
- Operation metadata throughout the process

## 4. Transitions and Conditions

### Valid State Transitions

#### From Initial State
- **Requested → Validating**
  - Condition: New scaling operation initiated
  - Trigger: `startScalingOperation` call
  - Data Required: Valid scaling operation parameters

#### From Validation and Planning States
- **Validating → Planning**
  - Condition: All validation checks pass
  - Trigger: Validation completion
  - Data Required: Validated operation parameters

- **Validating → Failed**
  - Condition: Any validation check fails
  - Trigger: Validation failure
  - Data Required: Validation error details

- **Planning → ResourceAllocating**
  - Condition: Planning completes successfully
  - Trigger: Planning completion
  - Data Required: Resource allocation plan

- **Planning → Failed**
  - Condition: Planning encounters errors
  - Trigger: Planning failure
  - Data Required: Planning error details

#### From Execution States
- **ResourceAllocating → InstancePreparing**
  - Condition: All required resources successfully allocated
  - Trigger: Resource allocation completion
  - Data Required: Allocated resource details

- **ResourceAllocating → Failed**
  - Condition: Resource allocation fails
  - Trigger: Resource allocation failure
  - Data Required: Resource allocation error details

- **InstancePreparing → Configuring**
  - Condition: All instances successfully prepared
  - Trigger: Instance preparation completion
  - Data Required: Prepared instance details

  - Trigger: Finalization completion
  - Data Required: Post-operation metrics

- **Finalizing → Failed**
  - Condition: Finalization fails
  - Trigger: Finalization failure
  - Data Required: Finalization error details

#### Universal Transitions
- **Any State → Canceled**
  - Condition: Cancellation request received
  - Trigger: `cancelScalingOperation` call
  - Data Required: Cancellation reason

### Special Transition Considerations

#### Cooldown Periods
- Transitions to **Requested** state should respect cooldown periods
- Scale-in operations: Respect scale-in cooldown
- Scale-out operations: Respect scale-out cooldown

#### Concurrent Operations
- Multiple scaling operations cannot be in progress simultaneously for the same cluster
- A new operation can only transition to **Requested** state if no other operation is active

#### Forced Transitions
- Administrator override can force certain transitions
- Documented for audit purposes
- Requires elevated permissions

## 5. Error Handling and Recovery Paths

### Error Categories

#### Validation Errors
- **Policy Constraint Violations**
  - Examples: Min/max instance count, cooldown period violations
  - Handling: Fail fast, provide clear error message, suggest resolution
  - Recovery: Manual correction of parameters and resubmission

- **Resource Availability Errors**
  - Examples: Insufficient quota, capacity constraints
  - Handling: Log detailed resource constraints, notify administrators
  - Recovery: Wait for resources to be available, request quota increase

#### Execution Errors
- **Resource Allocation Failures**
  - Examples: Provider API errors, resource reservation failures
  - Handling: Release any partially allocated resources, log details
  - Recovery: Automatic retry with exponential backoff (up to 3 times)

- **Instance Preparation Failures**
  - Examples: Instance creation failure, template errors
  - Handling: Clean up any partially created instances
  - Recovery: Retry with alternative template or configuration

- **Configuration Failures**
  - Examples: Network configuration errors, software setup failures
  - Handling: Attempt rollback to previous configuration
  - Recovery: Manual intervention may be required

- **Verification Failures**
  - Examples: Health check failures, service startup issues
  - Handling: Log detailed verification results, notify administrators
  - Recovery: Automatic retry for transient issues, manual repair for persistent problems

#### System Errors
- **State Machine Corruption**
  - Examples: Data inconsistency, persistence failures
  - Handling: Log error, transition to Failed state
  - Recovery: Manual administrative intervention required

- **Timeout Errors**
  - Examples: Operation exceeding maximum allowed duration
  - Handling: Log last known status, transition to Failed state
  - Recovery: Context-dependent, may require investigation

### Recovery Mechanisms

#### Automatic Recovery
- **Retryable Operations**
  - Resource allocation: 3 retries with exponential backoff
  - Networking configuration: 2 retries with different parameters
  - Health checks: 5 retries with linear backoff

- **Partial Success Handling**
  - For scale-out: Keep successfully added instances, report partial success
  - For scale-in: Report partially completed operation, allow manual completion

#### Manual Recovery
- **Administrator Intervention**
  - Required for: System errors, unrecoverable execution errors
  - Actions available: Force state transitions, edit operation parameters
  - Tools: Administrative API for state machine manipulation

- **Rollback Capabilities**
  - Configuration rollback: Revert to previous known-good configuration
  - Instance rollback: Remove newly added instances, restore removed instances
  - Complete rollback: Return to pre-operation state entirely

### Error Reporting
- **User Notifications**
  - Error reports with clear explanations and suggested actions
  - Progress updates during recovery attempts
  - Links to relevant documentation

- **Administrative Alerts**
  - Critical errors trigger immediate alerts
  - Escalation paths for errors requiring intervention
  - Periodic reports on error trends and patterns

### Failure Isolation
- Failures in one scaling operation should not affect other operations
- System should remain operational even during scaling failures
- Failed operations should not leave the system in an inconsistent state

The diagram shows the basic state transitions. Each state can transition to Failed or Canceled (though not all arrows are shown for clarity).

## 7. Implementation Considerations

### Data Structure Design

#### State Representation
- State should be modeled as an enum in Rust
- Each state variant should include associated data relevant to that state
- Include a timestamp field for measuring duration in state

```rust
pub enum ScalingPhase {
    Requested {
        operation: ScalingOperation,
        requested_at: i64,
    },
    Validating {
        operation: ScalingOperation,
        started_at: i64,
    },
    Planning {
        operation: ScalingOperation,
        started_at: i64,
        pre_metrics: Option<ScalingMetrics>,
    },
    // Other states follow similar pattern
    Failed {
        operation: ScalingOperation,
        failed_at: i64,
        failure_reason: String,
        failure_phase: String,
    },
    // etc.
}
```

#### State Manager
- Implement a `ScalingManager` struct to manage state transitions
- Include validation for state transitions
- Provide methods for querying state and history

### Integration Points

#### Integration with InstanceCluster
- Extend `InstanceCluster` with a field for the scaling state manager
- Add methods for initiating and managing scaling operations
- Implement persistence of scaling state in the cluster

#### Integration with Existing Operations
- Ensure compatibility with existing scaling methods
- Gradually migrate from simple scaling to state machine-based scaling
- Provide backward compatibility for API consumers

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests
- Test each state transition individually
- Mock external dependencies (resource allocation, instance creation)
- Verify state properties are correctly maintained

#### Integration Tests
- Test complete flows from start to finish
- Test error handling and recovery paths
- Verify persistence and recovery from stored state

#### Simulation Tests
- Create test scenarios that simulate various failure conditions
- Test timeouts and retry logic
- Verify system resilience under stress

### Performance Considerations

- Keep state transitions lightweight and non-blocking
- Use asynchronous processing for long-running operations
- Implement efficient persistence mechanisms
- Minimize lock contention in concurrent scenarios

### Security Considerations

- Validate permissions for state transitions
- Log all state changes for audit purposes
- Implement secure persistence of sensitive state data
- Ensure proper authentication for administrative operations
