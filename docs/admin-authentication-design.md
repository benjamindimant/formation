# Formation Admin Tool Authentication System Design

This document outlines the authentication system design for the Formation Admin Tool, providing a secure and scalable approach to user authentication and authorization.

## 1. Authentication Method

### 1.1 JWT-Based Authentication

The Formation Admin Tool will use JSON Web Token (JWT) based authentication with the following characteristics:

- **Token-based**: No server-side session storage required
- **Stateless**: Each request contains all the information needed for authentication
- **Secure**: Tokens are signed to prevent tampering
- **Expirable**: Tokens have a configurable lifespan
- **Revocable**: Ability to revoke tokens in case of security concerns

### 1.2 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- **TOTP Integration**: Support for Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) via authenticator apps
- **Backup Codes**: Generation of one-time backup codes for account recovery
- **SMS Verification**: Optional SMS verification for critical operations
- **Adaptive Authentication**: Risk-based authentication that adjusts security requirements based on context

### 1.3 Authentication Flow

1. User submits credentials (username/password)
2. System validates credentials against stored hash
3. If MFA is enabled, system requests and validates second factor
4. Upon successful authentication, system issues JWT token
5. Client stores token and sends it with subsequent requests
6. Server validates token signature and claims for each request

## 2. Token Format and Lifecycle

### 2.1 JWT Token Structure

The JWT token will consist of three parts:

1. **Header**:
   ```json
   {
     "alg": "RS256",
     "typ": "JWT"
   }
   ```

2. **Payload**:
   ```json
   {
     "sub": "user-uuid",
     "iat": 1625856000,
     "exp": 1625942400,
     "iss": "formation-admin",
     "aud": "formation-api",
     "role": "service_admin",
     "permissions": ["service:read", "service:write"],
     "jti": "unique-token-id"
   }
   ```

3. **Signature**: HMAC-SHA256(base64UrlEncode(header) + "." + base64UrlEncode(payload), secret)

### 2.2 Token Claims

- `sub`: Subject (user identifier)
- `iat`: Issued At timestamp
- `exp`: Expiration timestamp
- `iss`: Issuer (Formation Admin)
- `aud`: Audience (Formation API)
- `role`: User's role
- `permissions`: Array of granted permissions
- `jti`: JWT ID (unique identifier for the token)

### 2.3 Token Lifecycle

- **Token Issuance**: Generated upon successful authentication
- **Access Token Lifespan**: Short-lived (15-60 minutes)
- **Refresh Token Lifespan**: Longer-lived (24 hours to 7 days)
- **Token Refresh Process**: 
  1. Client sends refresh token to /auth/refresh endpoint
  2. Server validates refresh token and issues new access token
  3. Optionally, a new refresh token is also issued
- **Token Revocation**: 
  1. On logout
  2. On password change
  3. On detection of suspicious activity
  4. Via administrator action

## 3. Key Management

### 3.1 Signing Keys

- **Asymmetric Cryptography**: RS256 (RSA Signature with SHA-256)
- **Key Rotation**: Regular key rotation schedule (quarterly)
- **Key Protection**: Keys stored in secure key management system (HashiCorp Vault or AWS KMS)
- **Key Versioning**: Support for multiple active keys during rotation periods

### 3.2 Key Security Measures

- **Private Key Protection**: Private keys never exposed outside the authentication service
- **Key Encryption**: Keys encrypted at rest
- **Access Controls**: Strict permission controls for key access
- **Audit Logging**: All key operations logged for security auditing

### 3.3 Token Validation Keys

- **Public Key Distribution**: Public keys available via JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) endpoint
- **Key ID (kid)**: Each token includes reference to the key used for signing
- **Caching**: Clients can cache public keys for efficient verification

## 4. Authorization Mechanism

### 4.1 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- **Predefined Roles**: 
  - Super Administrator
  - Service Administrator
  - Monitoring User
  - Developer
- **Role Hierarchy**: Roles inherit permissions from less privileged roles
- **Role Assignment**: Users assigned one primary role

### 4.2 Permission Structure

Permissions follow a resource:action format:
- `service:read` - View service details
- `service:write` - Modify service configuration
- `service:control` - Start/stop/restart services
- `user:read` - View user details
- `user:write` - Create/modify users
- `config:read` - View configurations
- `config:write` - Modify configurations
- `log:read` - View logs
- `system:read` - View system metrics
- `system:write` - Modify system settings

### 4.3 Permission Evaluation

1. **Token Validation**: Verify token signature and expiration
2. **Role Check**: Extract role from token
3. **Permission Check**: 
   - Check if user's role grants required permission
   - Check if user has explicit permission grant or deny
4. **Resource-Level Authorization**: 
   - Verify user has access to the specific resource being accessed
   - Apply resource-specific access controls

### 4.4 Dynamic Authorization

- **Context-Aware**: Consider request context (time, IP, etc.)
- **Resource Ownership**: Additional checks for resource ownership
- **Attribute-Based**: Support for attribute-based access control (ABAC)
- **Policy Enforcement Point**: Centralized policy enforcement

## 5. Security Considerations

### 5.1 Token Security

- **Transport Security**: All API traffic over HTTPS
- **Token Storage**: Client-side storage recommendations (HttpOnly cookies for web apps)
- **CSRF Protection**: Implementation of Cross-Site Request Forgery protections
- **XSS Mitigation**: Content Security Policy and output encoding

### 5.2 Authentication Protections

- **Brute Force Protection**: Account lockout after failed attempts
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- **IP Monitoring**: Detection of authentication attempts from unusual locations
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of authentication events

### 5.3 Secure Credential Storage

- **Password Hashing**: Argon2id with appropriate parameters
- **Salting**: Unique salt per password
- **No Plain Text**: Passwords never stored or transmitted in plain text
- **MFA Secret Storage**: MFA secrets encrypted at rest

## 6. Implementation Technologies

### 6.1 Core Technologies

- **JWT Library**: jose or jsonwebtoken
- **Cryptography**: OpenSSL or platform-native cryptography libraries
- **Password Hashing**: Argon2id implementation
- **Key Management**: Integration with HashiCorp Vault or AWS KMS

### 6.2 Integration Points

- **Identity Providers**: Support for integration with external IdPs (OIDC, SAML)
- **Directory Services**: Optional LDAP/Active Directory integration
- **SSO**: Support for Single Sign-On within the Formation ecosystem
