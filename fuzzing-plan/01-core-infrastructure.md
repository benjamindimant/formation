# Core Fuzzing Infrastructure

## Shared Fuzzing Utilities

```rust
// form-fuzzing/src/lib.rs
pub mod instrumentation;
pub mod generators;
pub mod mutators;
pub mod reporters;
pub mod harness;
pub mod constants;
pub mod monitoring;
```

### Key Components:

1. **Instrumentation Module**: For instrumenting code paths and tracking coverage
   - Code path tracking
   - Sanitizer hooks
   - Fault injection framework
   - Measurement tools

2. **Generators Module**: Smart input generators for various data types
   - Network packet generators
   - API request generators
   - Configuration generators
   - Protocol message generators
   - File format generators

3. **Mutators Module**: Input mutation strategies
   - Bit/byte flipping
   - Dictionary-based mutations
   - Protocol-aware mutations
   - Evolutionary algorithms

4. **Reporters Module**: Detailed reporting and analysis
   - Crash reporting
   - State corruption detection
   - Performance degradation reporting
   - Log analysis tools
   - Visualization of code coverage

5. **Harness Module**: Reusable fuzzing harnesses
   - Component isolation utilities
   - Mock service implementations
   - State restoration tools
   - Safe execution environment

6. **Monitoring Module**: Live monitoring for fuzzing campaigns
   - Progress tracking
   - Coverage visualization
   - Regression detection
   - Resource consumption tracking

## Integration with CI/CD

1. **Continuous Fuzzing Pipeline**
   - Dedicated fuzzing jobs in CI
   - Coverage-guided fuzzing optimization
   - Crash triage automation
   - Regression testing with previous failing inputs

2. **Local Development Integration**
   - Easy-to-use CLI for developers
   - Pre-commit hooks with minimal fuzzing
   - IDE integration for instant feedback

## Live Environment Fuzzing

1. **Shadow Traffic Analysis**
   - Capture and replay real traffic with mutations
   - Compare outputs between production and shadow environments
   - Gradual traffic shifting for validation

2. **Canary Testing Framework**
   - Limited deployment of fuzzing to production
   - Automatic rollback on detected issues
   - Telemetry and anomaly detection

## Corpus Management

1. **Distributed Corpus Storage**
   - Shared corpus across CI runners
   - Versioned corpus tied to codebase versions
   - Minimization and de-duplication services

2. **Seed Input Collection**
   - Integration of real-world data
   - Manual crafting of edge cases
   - Automatic extraction from tests

## Resource Management

1. **Compute Optimization**
   - Parallelized fuzzing
   - Distributed execution framework
   - Priority-based scheduling

2. **Time Budget Allocation**
   - Component-based time allocation
   - Risk-based resource distribution
   - Incremental fuzzing strategies
