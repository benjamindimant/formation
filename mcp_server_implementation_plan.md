## Table of Contents

## 1. Introduction and Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for implementing a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for the Formation network. The MCP server will serve as a management control plane that enables AI agents and operators to manage workload lifecycles securely and efficiently. By following the MCP specification, our implementation will be compatible with various AI clients while providing powerful management capabilities specific to the Formation network.

### 1.2 Current Architecture

The Formation network currently provides capabilities for:

1. **Peer-to-peer networking** via formnet
2. **VM provisioning and management** 
3. **Resource usage monitoring**
4. **DNS-based routing** with health awareness
5. **Bootstrap node discovery**

However, these capabilities currently lack a standardized interface for AI agents to interact with the system programmatically.

### 1.3 Proposed Architecture with MCP

The proposed architecture adds an MCP server that:

1. **Provides standardized interfaces** for AI agents to manage workloads
2. **Secures access** to Formation network management functions
3. **Enables automation** of common management tasks
4. **Exposes metrics and telemetry** for intelligent decision-making
5. **Maintains audit records** of all management actions

## 2. Technical Background

### 2.1 Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized protocol for AI models to interact with external tools and data sources. Key features include:

- **Standardized API format** for tools to expose their capabilities
- **Resource mentions** allowing AI to reference specific resources
- **Structured input/output** for reliable tool interactions
- **Authentication mechanisms** for secure access control
- **Discoverability** of available tools and their capabilities

### 2.2 Formation Network Management

The Formation network requires various management operations:

- **VM lifecycle management**: Creation, monitoring, scaling, and termination
- **Network configuration**: Routing, DNS, and connectivity management
- **Resource allocation**: CPU, memory, storage, and network bandwidth
- **Health monitoring**: Service health, performance metrics, and alerts
- **Security operations**: Access control, audit, and policy enforcement

### 2.3 Integration Points

The MCP server will integrate with the Formation network at several key points:

1. **VM Management API**: For lifecycle operations on virtual machines
2. **Formnet Configuration**: For network management and peer discovery
3. **Metrics Collection**: For health monitoring and resource optimization
4. **DNS & Routing**: For network address management
5. **Authentication System**: For secure access to management functions
