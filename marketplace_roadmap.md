# AI Agent and Model Marketplace Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the transition from a general-purpose "decentralized EC2/VPS platform" to a focused AI Agent and Model Marketplace. This pivot leverages our existing infrastructure while creating a specialized platform for AI agent and model deployment, discovery, and monetization.
